### Hi! :wave:

I'm Stephen (He/Him)

I work at [Globus](https://www.globus.org/), a divison of the University of
Chicago.

There's [a website](https://sirosen.net) where I write things down sometimes,
like my intro to `awk`,
[Demystifying Magical Robot Farts](https://sirosen.net/2021/09/05/magical-robot-farts.html).

### Creations :tada:

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/sirosen/dotfiles) repo has lots of interesting
and handy tidbits.

#### pre-commit hooks

These projects are hooks for use with [pre-commit](pre-commit.com).

- [check-jsonschema](https://github.com/sirosen/check-jsonschema) - A
    JSONSchema checker which integrates with schemastore

- [texthooks](https://github.com/sirosen/texthooks) - A set of hooks for
    checking any text files

#### Globus projects

At Globus, I have been one of the primary authors of

- [The Globus Python SDK](https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python)
- [The Globus CLI](https://github.com/globus/globus-cli)

among other various projects.

### Contributions

I'm one of the maintainers of
[webargs](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/webargs)

I'm the current maintainer of [nose2](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2).
(But I don't get much time for it these days.)

I also contribute to other projects like
[marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) and
[SchemaStore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore) as I'm able.
